# Winning-at-jeopardy

In this project we analyze questions from jeopardy for patterns so we'd have a shot at winning the game.
To start we see if questions themselves have answer terminology. 
We also check to see if questions are often recycled. 
Further we also check if there are some terms used more in higher value questions or lower value questions by doing a chi-square test.
